## 🔍 Problem Statement

Academic research is often slowed by:

- ⚠️ **Information Overload**: Hard to scan thousands of papers and find novelty.
- 🤯 **Lack of Guidance**: Early-stage researchers struggle to craft strong problem statements and methodologies.
- ⏳ **Time-Consuming Citations**: Manual citation formatting (APA, MLA, IEEE) is tedious.
- 🌍 **Barriers to Entry**: Non-native English speakers and under-resourced institutions struggle with academic writing standards.
